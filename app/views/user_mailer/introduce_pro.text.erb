On Silicon Valley platforms you and your data are the product being sold to big corporate sponsors. At Gab we pride ourselves on being 100% funded by our community and treating every user with the respect and dignity they deserve.

Have you heard about GabPRO yet? It’s our optional subscription service that unlocks additional features on the site and helps us fund the development of the platform. GabPRO members can create groups, get verified, schedule posts, and much more. 

We hope you’ll consider supporting our mission of defending free speech online for all people and thank you again for being a valued member of our growing community!

At Gab we aren’t just building a social network, we are building an alternative to Silicon Valley tyranny. Our mission is to defend free speech online at all costs and we’ve certainly paid the price for standing by this mission. 

To date Gab has been banned from dozens of services providers including app stores, payment processors, hosting providers, and even VISA. We spent two years building our own infrastructure from the ground up and thanks to the support from our community we made it happen. 

Gab is only possible because we have people like you who help us to fund the development and operation of the Gab platform. We hope you’ll consider upgrading to GabPRO, our optional subscription service, to unlock additional features on Gab and help us defend free speech online for all people. GabPRO members can create groups, get verified, schedule posts, and much more. 

Thanks for being a valued member of our growing community!

Gab is a proud American free speech software company. We build technology products with the primary purpose of defending and exporting the uniquely American value of free speech to the entire world.

Gab also follows American privacy law in regards to protecting user data. We believe that privacy is a human right and that the dignity of a sovereign individual should be respected.

We don’t just say these things, we actively defend these values everyday. For example we regularly protect the privacy of international Gab users by turning down speech-related data requests and have been banned from dozens of services providers for our values of free speech. 

We hope you’ll consider upgrading to GabPRO to help us defend free speech and protect digital privacy for millions of people around the world. GabPRO unlocks additional features on Gab and helps us fund the operation and development of the platform. 

Thank you for being a valued member of the Gab community!
